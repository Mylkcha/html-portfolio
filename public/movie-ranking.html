 <h1>The Best Movies According to Mycha</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Macquia</h3>
 <p>This movie makes me feel melancholic. It showcases the different struggles and happiness of child rearing 
on the perspective of an entity who lives much longer than a human.</p>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Beautiful graphics and many foreshadowing. I love the element of fantasy.</p>

<h3>Wicked</h3>
<p>An absolute labor of love from the crew. Very faithful to the original broadway play.</p>
